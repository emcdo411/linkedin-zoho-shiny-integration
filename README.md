## 🔁 AI Prompt Snippets

**1. Content/Post Prompt**

```
Write an honest LinkedIn post (~200 words) from a founder surviving a downturn: share a real challenge, what you learned, and what you offer clients now. Tone: humble, helpful, strong.
```

**2. Cold Email Prompt**

```
Generate a 3-step outreach sequence: connection request, follow-up with a value piece, and scheduling ask. Should sound human, not spammy.
```

**3. Memo Prompt**

```
Write a professional memo to a lender/advisory board: outline current cash runway (6 months), active clients, AI and marketing plan, and how requested microloan will be used.
```

## 🔍 Key Takeaways

* Stretch your runway through ethical automation and lean design
* Generate leads by building trust, not hype
* Use your founder journey as the content — experience is the asset
* Stay visible, disciplined, and transparent in your communication

  end
```

### Summary:

* **Zoho CRM** collects and organizes LinkedIn leads.
* **Google Sheets** acts as an intermediary, syncing leads to an **RShiny dashboard** for real-time monitoring.
* **Azure Cost Management** is optionally polled to align tech spend with CRM activity.
* **GitHub Actions** automate checks for new lead data and trigger RShiny rebuilds or log updates.
* All of this can run without PowerBI or Dynamics 365, keeping costs low and tools familiar.
